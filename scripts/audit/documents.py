"""What the documents must satisfy, since `AGENTS.md`'s writing rules had nothing behind them.

`AGENTS.md` states five rules for writing the documentation and names an enforcer for none
of them. Its own fourth rule says what that means: **a rule that is not checked is a
comment.** Three of the five were broken between 2026-08-29 and 2026-09-07 —
[ADR-0039](../../docs/adr/0039-the-design-document-was-narrating-its-own-corrections.md)
cut 2,200 words of past-tense self-correction out of `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and nine days later
the same shape was back, one paragraph of it added by the agent doing the cleaning.

Three things are checkable and each one caught a real violation on the day it was written:

1. **Tense.** `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `AGENTS.md` say what is true now; `docs/adr/` says how
   it came to be. A dated self-correction — a line carrying both a date and a past-tense
   verb — is the shape that keeps coming back, and there were eight.
2. **Links.** Every relative link in the documents and in source doc comments must resolve.
   Seven of the twenty-two in source pointed nowhere, all by miscounting `../`.
3. **The ADR index.** No duplicate or missing number, index and directory agreeing in both
   directions, every record carrying a Status and a Date.

What this cannot check is whether a quoted figure is current, which is the fifth rule and
the one that cost the most: `TESTING.md` stood eight days at 4× wrong. A number's freshness
is not a property of its text. What the rule asks for instead is a *derivation beside the
number*, and that is a habit rather than a pattern.
